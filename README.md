## üìù Process

Starting with setting up Appwrite, I then proceeded to implement authentication. Following this, I established routing, both public and private, and focused on designing the sidebar, top bar, and other essential components. From there, I developed pages such as the home feed, explore, and user directory, etc.

Afterward, I delved into refining the finer details, such as implementing drag-and-drop functionality for images and files, enabling post saving, and incorporating profile customization options like changing the profile picture, name, and bio.

The most challenging aspect was determining backend on the appwrite because it is new for me and it is a valuable skill I acquired during this process was setting up Appwrite, which was entirely new to me and is something I'll carry forward into future projects.
