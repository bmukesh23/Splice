## üìù Process

I started by jotting down in my notebook what features I wanted. I often use Instagram Web, so I tried to draw inspiration from that.

Starting with setting up Appwrite, I then proceeded to implement authentication. Following this, I established routing, both public and private, and focused on designing the sidebar, top bar, and other essential components. From there, I developed pages such as the home feed, explore, and user directory, etc.

Afterward, I delved into refining the finer details, such as implementing drag-and-drop functionality for images and files, enabling post saving, and incorporating profile customization options like changing the profile picture, name, and bio. Initially, I didn't have a specific design concept in mind; I built everything from scratch and gradually developed ideas regarding colors and styling.

The most challenging aspect was determining the optimal data structure. One valuable skill I acquired during this process was setting up Appwrite, which was entirely new to me and is something I'll carry forward into future projects.

- **Mutual Following**: Foster connections between users by implementing mutual following capabilities.
  
- **Testing Implementation**: Improve project stability and reliability by implementing thorough testing procedures in the future.
